# Unsupervised Mode

In unsupervised mode Claude never asks questions, applies autonomous defaults, and keeps working until the task is done or genuinely blocked. State lives in the repo, so an interrupted run resumes cleanly anywhere.

**Relationship to `/auto-resume`.** Unsupervised = *how* Claude works (no questions, proactive pause near the limit). Auto-resume = *whether* an interrupted run wakes itself after the limit resets. The coupling is **one-directional**: turning unsupervised **on always ensures auto-resume is on** (an autonomous run must be able to recover from a limit kill — otherwise it just dies), but turning unsupervised **off leaves auto-resume untouched**, and `/auto-resume` can be on entirely on its own (e.g. supervised recovery). So auto-resume is toggled independently *except* that unsupervised implies it.

## Usage
```
/unsupervised on          # enable (proactive pause at 90% where usage is readable)
/unsupervised on 80       # enable, pause at 80%
/unsupervised off
/unsupervised             # show status + usage
```

## Instructions

### `on [threshold]`
Write to `.claude/memory/local-settings.md` (create if missing; default threshold 90):
```
unsupervised: true
usage_threshold: {threshold or 90}
```
**Always ensure auto-resume is on too** (an unsupervised run must be able to recover after a limit kill): if `auto_resume: true` isn't already in local-settings.md, add it now, and — if in-progress work exists and this is a cloud session — arm the recovery heartbeat (idempotent, per `/auto-resume`). Don't disturb it if it's already on.

Print what it will do (never ask): the autonomous defaults below, the proactive pause at the threshold where usage is readable, and that auto-resume is now on (was already on / just enabled) so an interrupted run wakes itself after the limit resets.

### `off`
Remove the `unsupervised:` / `usage_threshold:` lines from local-settings.md. Print `Unsupervised mode OFF.` **Leaves `auto_resume` and any heartbeat as-is** — auto-resume was auto-enabled but is not auto-disabled here (turn it off deliberately with `/auto-resume off` if you no longer want limit-recovery).

### (no argument)
Print unsupervised state + threshold from local-settings.md, then `bash .claude/hooks/usage-guard.sh --status`.

## Autonomous defaults (when `unsupervised: true`)
- **Never** ask the user — apply the most reasonable default and note assumptions.
- `/plan` — reasonable defaults for open questions, noted in the spec; default to in-scope.
- `/implement` — proceed through subtasks; `/consult` when genuinely stuck rather than asking.
- **Merge** — local git per the Merge policy (no PR).
- `/release` — needs the bump type as an argument (`/ship … minor` or `/release minor`).
- **Blocker** (merge conflict unresolvable, missing credentials, unresolvable ambiguity) → write `## Blocked` (reason + what's required) to `.claude/memory/context-{branch}.md` and stop.
- **Done** → clear `## Ship`/`## Blocked` notes and post a short final report (what shipped, anything deferred, anything blocked) so you can see what happened on return.

## Pause behavior
- **Where usage is readable** (local terminal / VS Code): the usage-guard hook fires at the threshold (default 90%) → finish the atomic step, commit, end the turn; resume when usage recovers (automatically if `/auto-resume` is on, otherwise on the next session).
- **Where it isn't** (cloud/docker): no proactive pause — the session runs into the hard limit. If `/auto-resume` is on, the heartbeat resumes it after reset; repo-as-checkpoint caps the loss at the current subtask.

> Supervised mode (unsupervised off) has **no** proactive pause — Claude works to the hard limit and, if `/auto-resume` is on, continues after the reset.
